      <td valign="top"><span>In September 2008, OSEP sent a memo to Chief State School Officers regarding APR requirements under Sections 616 and 642 of the Individuals with Disabilities Act. The purpose of this memorandum is twofold.</p>
        <p>First, the memorandum reiterates the steps a state must take in order to report that previously identified noncompliance has been corrected. Second, the memorandum describes how to factor evidence of correction into the analysis of whether the State has demonstrated substantial compliance for purposes of determinations under sections 616 and 642 of the IDEA (beginning with the Department’s 2010 determination based on a review of the FFY 2008 APRs).</p>
        <p>This memorandum also addresses concerns identified in OSEP’s review of States’ FFY 2005 and FFY 2006 APRs about identification and correction of noncompliance and low performance in compliance areas.        </p>

      <td valign="top"><span>This presentation was originally delivered at the 2008 OSEP Leadership Conference with an accompanying Power Point file. In order to reach a broader audience and to provide this information in an accessible, self-paced format, this online training was developed. Using the online module format enables states to have ready access to this information for staff development and training purposes. States may wish to require that state staff members as well as local administrators and service providers complete the training to ensure their full understanding of the requirements addressed. In addition, this format enables OSEP to make the more current information available in the same place at all times. That is, you don’t need to ask where to find the most recent version of this guidance: it will always reside here.</span></td>
